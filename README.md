# Kosmos-Synesis

**Kosmos-Synesis** is an automated scientific research platform using Artificial Intelligence. It is designed to search, read, and interpret scientific articles from the arXiv repository, with a special focus on physics and cosmology. The system can generate summaries, cross-reference information, and even propose new hypotheses based on the analyzed literature.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Search:** Automatically searches for relevant articles on arXiv based on user-defined keywords and filters.
*   **Text Interpretation:** Uses advanced AI models to read and understand the content of the articles.
*   **Automatic Summarization:** Generates concise and informative summaries of the analyzed articles.
*   **Information Synthesis:** Cross-references data from multiple sources to identify patterns and connections.
*   **Hypothesis Generation:** Explores the possibility of generating new research hypotheses based on the analyzed information.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/kosmos-synesis.git
    cd kosmos-synesis
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure your API key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

    > **Important Note:** An API key from the AI provider (e.g., Google Gemini) is required to use the Artificial Intelligence features of this project.

## Basic Usage (Web Interface)

To start the main application, run the Streamlit file:

```bash
streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
```

This will open a web interface where you can interact with the system, search for articles, and view the results generated by the AI.

## Programmatic Usage (for Developers)

For those who wish to use the backend modules directly, the `src/gemini_api.py` file contains an example of how to use the `GeminiAPI` class programmatically.

After configuring your `.env` file, you can run the script directly to see a demonstration:

```bash
python src/gemini_api.py
```

This script demonstrates:
*   How to instantiate the `GeminiAPI` class.
*   A simple API call without a RAG context.
*   A call using a simulated RAG context to generate an augmented response.

## Examples

For more practical examples and usage demonstrations, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory.
